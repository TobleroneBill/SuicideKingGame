Using Programming Patterns to make a lil platflormer

I have been reading: 'Game Programming Patterns' by Robert Nystrom, because my game development game WEAK AF. I was previously using C++, but its more complicated as a language compared to python, making it more difficult to test out these design principles. Once I finish this, I hope to go back to C++, and make some more simple things using SFML, since I was making good progress before I went on a hiatus.

I feel python is really good for rapid prototyping, and I have since found out how to port my pygames into web assembly. My main goals with this is to:
- Get a game out as quickly as possible
- Develop a core understanding of 2 programming patterns:
    - Commands - To record user input, and create a replay system
    - Flyweights - To make levels that use less resources and hypothetically will be easier to make
- Make something fun, that is easiy accessable for others to play

I generally try to make all my stuff usable online, because most people dont have the patience to download a zip file (myself included). I hope that by the end of this I will have clean code and a fun game, but who knows where this will end up (if I even finish it).

This is a link to my general Deisgn Documentation:

Not sure how to document this process though, so after my inital setup day, I'll be focusing on a quick and easy way to do that (probably a blog, since I have no access to adquete video editors at the moment).
