# Flyweight Pattern
#   General Block - Sprite, Solid, Kills, (aabb i guess)
#   Block types:
#       Rock - Solid
#       Wood - Solid, Can be set on fire (Spawns fire entity and deletes)
#       Spikes - Solid, kills
#       Water - not solid, slows movement and can kill after a long time (when breath runs out)
#       Hot Coals - Doesnt kill, but makes player jump like mario 64 in lava
